Good morning!
Early question:
What framework would you recommend for unit testing in Angular?  Jasmine, Jest or Mocha?
Azariah Engelbrecht
14:35
   Jest :)
Sander Elias
14:40
I'll second Jest.
Adam Murray
14:41
Same. I prefer Jest.
Arjun Shankar
14:45
should I move to jest ....
Sander Elias
14:45
Yes.
I can use tons of words, but it boils down to.
yes.

Looking for something for visual regression on Angular components? :( Anyone?
Sander Elias
14:48
hmm, Adam? any idea? 
Cyores is working/has visual regresion stuff, but I don't know its current state.

@azariah one option that you could look at is percy.io

re: Angular viz Percy works well with Cypress. we've also seen folks have decent luck using this with Cypress https://www.npmjs.com/package/cypress-plugin-snapshots
Azariah Engelbrecht
14:53
@Paul that lib is so buggy :( last publish to it was about a year ago :(

I think perhaps will look into Percy.
Paul Jaffre
14:55
interesting @azariah, thanks for that info. wanted to give a couple of options, but that's why we recommend Percy first :-)
Azariah Engelbrecht
14:56
More options are WELCOME! @Paul :D

Here is a link to the tiny bit of the docs that explains that you don't need to wait for component compilation in CLI unit tests.

https://angular.io/guide/testing-components-scenarios#:~:text=That%27s%20not%20a%20problem%20when%20you%20run%20the%20CLI%20ng%20test%20command%20because%20it%20compiles%20the%20application%20before%20running%20the%20tests.

A smoke test is there to detect failures that will make your customers ears blow smoke...
Azariah Engelbrecht
15:01
LOL!!!!

Cypress Q:
is there a way we can see or group tags for cypress tests in the cypress dashboard ? 
(I am brand new using tags, I see tags for runs in the dashboard, but not the tags I added to my tests :((( )
I have to drop for a colliding meeting in 5 😅 but I will watch the recording 🤞
Angular Nation
15:06
We will be sure to answer your question, and we will do this again as well, thanks for coming Nati! 🥰
Natalia Cáceres

Component testin scenarios: https://angular.io/guide/testing-components-scenarios

I found this so confusing :(
Sander Elias
15:08
See, exactly what i said. Shai just using (Wayyyy) more words!
Shai Reznik
15:11
LOL
Angular Nation
15:12
we ❤️ you Shai 
Sander Elias
15:13
Remind me to add something about smoke tests after Nati is done.
Angular Nation
15:13
also it's a very important point you were making bc I've seen some teams really struggling trying to reach 100% test coverage
@sander +1
Shai Reznik
15:13
I don't know if I answered your question Ana... but if you need more clarification let me know
Natalia Cáceres
15:14
thank you guys! <3
Azariah Engelbrecht
15:14
100% test coverage doesn't mean much from a unit/component level. Need to cover critical paths first, like Shai said :D
Natalia Cáceres
15:14
be back later if you are still here
Ana Boca
15:15
@Shai You did 😀 - thank you thank you!
Shai Reznik
15:15
Sure thing sista! 😊🙌
